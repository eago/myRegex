Remember is a 2015 drama thriller film directed by Atom Egoyan and written by Benjamin 
August. Starring Christopher Plummer, Bruno Ganz, Jürgen Prochnow, Heinz Lieven, Henry 
Czerny, Dean Norris and Martin Landau, it was a co-production of Canada and Germany. 
The plot follows an elderly Holocaust survivor with dementia who sets out to kill a 
Nazi war criminal, and was inspired by 
August's consideration that there were fewer parts for senior actors in recent years.
